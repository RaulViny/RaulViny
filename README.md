## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello, my name is Raul. 
I have a background and experience in the administrative field, but Iâ€™m currently looking to transition into the tech industry as a developer."
Iâ€™m currently learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create front-end projects.

I believe that my administrative skills in process organization, communication, problem-solving, and planning can help me in this new field.
I would like to contribute with my skills to real projects, in order to improve my abilities more and more each day.
Feel free to ask me if you want to know more.
